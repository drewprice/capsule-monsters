## In development...
Because of its dependency on a Faye server, you must run this command along with a Rails server:

```bash
$ rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -E production
```

This runs the elasticsearch server, which is supporting the searchkick gem - this has the potential to impact heroku deployment

```bash
$ brew install elasticsearch
$ elasticsearch
$ rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=User
```
